# Summit-Pharma
I developed and launched the website for Summit Pharma, an Australian online natural therapy compounding pharmacy. The site features a user-friendly interface that allows patients to easily book telehealth consultations, access a variety of natural medicine products, and place orders for fast, discreet delivery. Key features include detailed product descriptions, secure online transactions, and resources for patient education. This project highlights my skills in creating functional and attractive websites tailored to the healthcare and wellness industry.
